            "description": "Defines the execution schedule of an operational rule in Cronspec format. The following general rules apply: 1. Each set of ranges can be preceded by a % sign which will change the meaning from absolute to relative number. For instance if [seconds] equals 29 the timer will get fired each time the absolute time ends with a number of seconds equal to 29 (e.g., 11:43:29) whereas %20 means every 20 seconds every minute, i.e. at 13:25:00, 13:25:20, 13:25:40, 13:26:00, etc. 2. Ranges are comma-separated lists. A range is made of a number eventually followed by a '-' sign and another number. 3. The wildcard character asterisks (*) may be used to indicate any value."
